### **Me**  
I am an Engineering PhD student at the University of Oxford, working at the intersection of machine learning, computational science, and multiphysics. My research focuses on developing multidisciplinary and multifidelity numerical tools to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon society.

### **Selected Research**  
I have worked on a variety of projects, including, but not limited to:

- **Accelerating Chemically Reacting Flow Simulations:** Using machine learning to elegantly speed up simulations of chemically reacting flows by three orders of magnitude.
- **Developing a 3D Viscous Unstructured Turbomachinery Flow Solver:** Created a multi-fidelity flow solver designed for both GPUs and CPUs.
- **Chemical Kinetic Solvers with Embedded Multi-objective Optimizers:** Developing solvers that incorporate multi-objective optimization techniques for improved performance.
- **High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Using high-fidelity CFD to investigate complex aerothermal, supersonic, highly turbulent interactions in a novel turbomachinery concept aimed at decarbonizing over 40 high-temperature processes.
