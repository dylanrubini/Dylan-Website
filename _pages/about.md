**Me** I am a engineering PhD student at the University of Oxford working at the intersection between machine learning, computational science and aerothermochemistry to develop multidisciplinary, multiphysics numerical tools accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon society.

**Research** I have worked on many different projects including:

- computationally accelerating chemically reacting flow simulations using machine learning
- developing a 3D viscous unstructured turbomachinery flow solver for GPUs and CPUs 
- developing chemical kinetic solvers with embedded multiobjective optimizer
- using high fidelity computational fluid dynamics to investigate the complex aerothermal interactions within a new turbomachinery for decarbonising high-temperature processes

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
