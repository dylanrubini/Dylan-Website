### **About Me**  
I enjoy working at the intersection of machine learning, computational science, and multiphysics. My current research focuses on developing  multiphysics tools accelerated by multifidelity machine learning, enabling the transition to a zero-carbon society.

### **Selected Research Projects**  
I have worked on a variety of projects, including, but not limited to:

- **Accelerating Chemically Reacting Flow Simulations:** Using machine learning to elegantly speed up simulations of chemically reacting flows by three orders of magnitude.
- **Developing a 3D Viscous Unstructured Turbomachinery Flow Solver:** Creating an unstructured mesh flow solver designed for both multiple GPUs and CPUs.
- **Chemical Kinetic Solvers with Embedded Multi-Objective Optimizers:** Developing solvers that incorporate multi-objective optimization techniques for improved reaction performance.
- **High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Using high-fidelity CFD to investigate complex aerothermal, supersonic, highly turbulent interactions in a novel turbomachinery concept aimed at decarbonizing over 40 high-temperature processes.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
